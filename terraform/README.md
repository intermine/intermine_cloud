```bash
apt install kubectl
```

### Helm

## Download the tar file
wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v2.14.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz

## extract the tar file
unzip helm-v2.14.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz

## move the application binary to path
sudo mv helm /usr/local/bin/helm

```

## Configure credentials

After installing required dependencies, you have to configure them with right credentials. This is a one time process.

### Terraform

Create a free account at https://app.terraform.io/signup and then follow instructions at https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud/tf_cloud_gettingstarted to create an organization, project and token that the terraform cli will use.

Then create a `.terraformrc` file in your home folder and add the following:
```
plugin_cache_dir   = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
disable_checkpoint = false
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
    token = "[your token]"
}
```

### GCloud

Create a service account using instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys

Add these roles to your service account:
 - Compute Admin
 - Compute Network Viewer
 - Kubernetes Engine Admin
 - Container Analysis Admin
 - Security Admin
 - Security Reviewer
 - Service Account User
 - Project IAM Admin

Then create a key and download the JSON file.

Create a creds folder at the root of this repo and add this JSON file to creds folder. Rename JSON file to gcp_creds.json

## Spinning up a new cluster

### Add terraform tfvars

You can configure the cluster parameters with the help of a `.tfvars file`.

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file at `intermine-cloud/terraform/intermine_cloud/gcp` folder and add the following things:
```
// This file may contains secrets
// Never add to git repo!!!!
// Assign values to variables according to project requirements.


credentials_file_path = "../../../creds/gcp_creds.json"
compute_engine_service_account = "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"
project_id = "[PROJECT_ID]"
project_region = "europe-west2"
project_regional_boolean = "false"
cluster_name = "[CLUSTER_NAME]"
cluster_name_suffix = ""
zones = ["europe-west2-a"]
http_load_balancing_boolean = "true"

```
### Initialise terrfaorm

```bash
## change dir to gcp directory
cd intermine-cloud/terraform/intermine_cloud/gcp

## init terraform
terraform init
```

### Create a new cluster

```bash
## terraform plan will show what resources it is going to create
terraform plan

## terraform apply will create those resources
terraform apply
```

### Destroy a cluster

```bash
## from the same dir where you did terraform init
terraform refresh && terraform destroy
```
